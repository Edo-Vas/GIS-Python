Hello world!

In this repository you can find a script that i developed for my university thesis. 
The script works with Google Earth Engine to analyze a dataset of locations and extract remotely sensed data.
In particular, it use NTL data to track the chinese's Xinjiang detention camps, where are held Uyghurs person.

## How use the script
The script it's developed in Python 3. You need to setup Anaconda and create a development environment, after you can use Jupyter Notebook to open the script inside the zip file.

You can use the requirements "requirements.txt" file to create the conda environment and install all the needed Python modules.
